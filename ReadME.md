# ionic-stock-FE-feature
- This project is a responsive FE  that displays stock data through chart.js

- This project uses Ionic 4 and Angular 7 to create a responsive FE that displays information using chart.js

- I decided to use Ionic 4/ Angular as it works well with a device cross-compatibility and has useful components that assist to make the application responsive.

- The application uses chart.js to help visualize the data. Chart.js is an open source chart tool that helps you make lightweight charts in HTML/javascript.

- The data used in this application is pulled from the "Financial Modeling Prep API". This website provides interesting data about stock trends for company's. The Data retrieved is the JSON format, which is then dynamically transcribed to the corresponding charts.

- The application also allows for users to leave comments about the stock data. This feature is device compatible.

- Note: This application can be deployed on both IOS and Android (And WEB)
